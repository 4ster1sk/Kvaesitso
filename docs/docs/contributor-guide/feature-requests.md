# Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature, just create a new issue. Please be as descriptive as possible, this will greatly enhance your chances of not simply being ignored.

Approved requests will be marked with the <span class="badge badge--info">enhancement</span> label. However this does not give any information about how soon the feature will be implemented.

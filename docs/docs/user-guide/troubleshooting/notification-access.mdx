# Notification Access on Android 13+

Starting with Android 13, notification access is restricted for sideloaded apps. If you sideloaded
the APK, you might need to perform some extra steps to enable notification access (which is required for the music widget and for notification badges):

1. Try to grant the notification access permission as you would normally do. If you sideloaded the APK, all the controls are disabled:

2. Tap on the disabled toggle “Allow notification access”. This dialog will show up:

<img src="/img/notification-access-2.png" width="300"/>

3. Tap “OK” to close the dialog.

4. Tap on the app icon. It leads to the app info screen.

5. Tap on the 3-dot-menu (<MoreVertRoundedIcon/>) in the top-right corner.

:::info
This menu only shows up if you have tried to enable a restricted setting before. **Step 2 is crucial for this to work.**

6. Tap on “Allow restricted settings”

7. Go back to the previous screen. The controls are no longer disabled, and you can allow notification access.

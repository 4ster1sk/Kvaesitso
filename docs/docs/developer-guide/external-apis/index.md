# External APIs

Kvæsitso integrates with a number of external APIs. Most of them require some sort of authentication, like an API key. These API keys are not part of the GitHub repository. If you want to build Kvæsitso from source with all features enabled, follow the steps in this chapter.

:::info
Kvæsitso is still buildable even without these steps, but some features will be disabled in the resulting APK. If all you need is a debug build for testing purposes, you can probably skip this chapter.

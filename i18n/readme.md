This module contains all data required for internationalization and localization. This includes
strings, icons (if they require localization), and config and default values. **All resources that
might need localization must go to this module.**

## Contribute

Currently looking into web translation services (e.g. Crowdin or something similar). For now just
manually translate the XML files or use Android Studio's Translations Editor and submit a pull
request with your changes.
